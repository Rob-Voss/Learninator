                    I ran across @karpathy's <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs">ConvNetJS</a> library and
                    demos,
                    and then later his <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/reinforcejs">REINFORCEjs</a> library and was
                    sucked
                    in after seeing the difference between how the pre-trained and newbie agents acted.
                    I was determined to freshen up my Javascript skills and play with the code until I understood it
                    better.
                    Thus my fun and educational exploration into deep learning took me down the path of learning mo
                    betta JavaScript skills as well.
                    Most of them were an exercise in converting the canvas drawing into using the <a
                        href="https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js">PIXI.js</a>
                    animation library and to build an set of Worlds and Entities and basic classes to extend and new and
                    exciting versions of the demos I fell in love with.

                <h3>Water World EXtreme</h3>
                <p>This time I took the concept of the Puck World demo and the Water World and added in an Entity Agent
                    Class.
                    The Entity Agent Class is using the same set up as the agent in the Puck World demo and I threw them
                    into Water World.
                    They will set one of the Agents as its enemy and try to avoid it, and then set other Agent as a
                    target to follow like a puppy dog.
                    What makes this especially fun is that they don't consume the resources, but they do collide with
                    everything
                    at twice the mass of the agent. That can lead to them making the agent work harder at catching it's
                    meals
                    because the Entity Agent rushed in and knocked them around.</p>

                    library.
                    I had fun trying to write my own basic Physics engine, but decided it would be better to just use an
                    established one.

                <p>This is a modification of <a href="https://github.com/karpathy">@karpathy</a>'s original demo, I had already made a Maze
                    generator and grid based positioning. This resulted in me making a new Maze every
                    reload instead of relying on a hard-coded environment state and instead could adjust
                    and generate the states via the generated Maze.
                    I added in some visible walls and the ability for the environment to dynamically generate a maze and fill
                    in the rewards and states based on its layout. For example dead ends are a -1 reward now. and the last
                    square that would be the exit from the maze is the +1 reward. As of right now the start is in the upper
                    left corner and the exit is in the lower right corner still.</p>
